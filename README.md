## DOT Serial to Fiber Solution

State Departments of Transportation (DOT) require dependable data links for roadside controllers, ITS components, and traffic sensors. Our serial-to-fiber solutions extend RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485 signals over fiber optics, ensuring secure, long-distance, and interference-free operation in the harshest roadside environments.

**Features:**
- Supports legacy serial equipment used in traffic control
- Immune to electrical noise and lightning-induced surges
- Available in DIN-rail and NEMA enclosures for roadside cabinets

## Homeland Security Fiber Optics

For border surveillance, command centers, and emergency operation centers, fiber optics provide the backbone for secure, high-speed communication. Our hardened fiber solutions enable reliable video, sensor, and access control system connectivity across long distances with military-grade protection.

**Benefits:**
- Secure data channels for national security applications
- Ruggedized enclosures and extended temperature support
- Support for HD video feeds, perimeter sensors, and encrypted control links

## RS-232 VMS Integration

Many Video Management Systems (VMS) still rely on RS-232 control signals for PTZ cameras, matrix switches, or alarm panels. Our RS-232 to fiber converters bridge these devices to central VMS platforms over fiber, enhancing distance, performance, and reliability.

**Applications:**
- Extend legacy RS-232-based camera control systems
- Integrate alarms and door sensors into fiber-based networks
- Compatible with major VMS brands and protocols

## Surveillance System Fiber Network

Design scalable surveillance backbones with our fiber optic media converters and switches. Ideal for city-wide, campus-wide, or industrial camera networks, these systems support high-resolution video transmission without signal loss or EMI vulnerability.

**Key Features:**
- Gigabit support for high-bandwidth video feeds
- Works with IP, HD-CVI, HD-TVI, and SDI camera systems
- Compatible with PoE devices and remote edge nodes

---

## Fire Station Data Over Fiber

Fire departments rely on real-time dispatch, building system integration, and secure network access. Our fiber solutions support all data and voice applications in fire stations and EMS hubs, enabling quick coordination and seamless interoperability with city networks.

**Use Cases:**
- VoIP, video, and access control system connectivity
- Fiber uplinks to municipal networks and dispatch centers
- EMI-resistant links for lightning-prone areas
